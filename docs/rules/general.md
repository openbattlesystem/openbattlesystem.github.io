# Rules
## Roll Offs
When two players disagree about a rule, have a roll off where one play picks the high number and one player picks the low number. Example on a D6 player 1 wins on a roll of 1, 2, or 3 and player 2 wins on a roll of 4, 5, or 6. Heads or tails would also work.

## Recommended Dice
The following dice are recommended for a standard game. They can be substituted to allow for a more varied game.
